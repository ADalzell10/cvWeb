      I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science eager to get my career started in a graduate role, and hopefully add my creativity and work ethic in helping companies strive forward within their business sector.
   </p>
   <p>
      I'm proficient in the use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, I have taken an online course in web development to keep improving and remain updated on any changes. I'm striving to continue learning within these languages and expand my knowledge set. I believe I can provide creative and innovative ideas on creating and implementing responsive and well-structured webpages.

      A role in web development would give me exactly what I hope to achieve, which is further learning and to become an expert in the field.
